## About Us

American Society on Aging (ASA) in collaboration with Nevada Senior Services (NSS) bring together leaders from the business, academic, government and nonprofit communities in aging. To unite, empower and champion our members, we have committed to the following strategic plan and priorities: To ensure ASA’s impact on optimizing the quality of life for older adults in America. By 2024, ASA will continue to lead the field of aging, institute stronger diversity, equity and inclusion practices, expand our membership and launch our policy and advocacy efforts.

Older adults (65+) are the fastest growing market segment and adopters of mobile technology. They are also the number #1 target for fraud and can often be marginalized and underserved in the digital transformation. On the flipside, community providers don't have the technical staff or budgets to develop secure and efficient digital communication channels. The Connie platform will work from both sides to bridge that gap and improve service delivery to in-need older adults in communities nationwide.
